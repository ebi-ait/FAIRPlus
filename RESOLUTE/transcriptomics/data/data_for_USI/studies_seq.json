			"value": "To enable successful SLC function deorphanization we aimed to select minimal number of cell lines covering expression of as many SLCs as possible based on publicly available RNA-Seq dataset of 675 cell lines (Klijn C. et al,Nat. Biotechnol. 2015). We generated transcriptome profile for 7 cell line which will be used in course of RESOLUTE project. RNA-Seq based transcriptome profile of 321-N1 and Jump In T-REx HEK 293, to our knowledge, have not been published before. Transcriptome of the RESOLUTE cell lines would be interesting to SLC community as a minimal set of cell lines covering maximal number of expressed SLC (approx. 80%).",
