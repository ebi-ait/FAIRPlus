	"description": "To enable successful SLC function deorphanization we aimed to select minimal number of cell lines covering expression of as many SLCs as possible based on publicly available RNA-Seq dataset of 675 cell lines (Klijn C. et al, Nat. Biotechnol. 2015). A set of 6 adherent human cell lines (HCT116, HuH-7, LS-180, MDA-MB-468, SK-MEL-28, 1321-N1) cumulatively covers expression of about 80 % of all SLCs (TPM  1). These cell lines will be used to generate SLC-knockout and SLC-overexpressing single cell clones. Additionally, Jump In T-REx HEK 293 cells will be used for generating SLC-overexpression cell lines.",

Transcriptome of the RESOLUTE cell lines would be interesting to SLC community as a minimal set of cell lines covering maximal number of expressed SLC (approx. 80%)."
